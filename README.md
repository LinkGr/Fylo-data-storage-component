## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I used mobile first concepts to develop the entire design and learned very efficient methods of adapting the design to different devices.

Furthermore, I built the entire layout with pure HTML and CSS only, strengthening the concepts in my head, making me create a more robust organization method.

### Continued development

For future projects I would like to continue with the mobile first method as I found it simpler to think about and develop than starting the approach on the desktop. I will also further reinforce the fundamental concepts of CSS to make development faster.
